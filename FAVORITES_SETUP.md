## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues:

3. **Check Authentication**: Ensure you're logged in before trying to favorite recipes
4. **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection

## Database Schema

The `favorite_recipes` table has the following structure:
- `id`: Primary key
- `user_id`: References the authenticated user
- `recipe_id`: The Spoonacular recipe ID
- `recipe_data`: Full recipe data as JSON
- `created_at`: Timestamp when favorited
- `updated_at`: Timestamp when last updated

The table includes Row Level Security policies to ensure users can only access their own favorites.
