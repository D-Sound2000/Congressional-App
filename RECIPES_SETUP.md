   - 12 diabetes-friendly recipes across breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack categories

## Troubleshooting

If search still doesn't work:

1. **Check Database Connection**
   - Look for error messages in console
   - Verify Supabase connection is working

2. **Verify Recipes Table**
   - Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recipes;
   ```
   - Should return 12

3. **Check Table Structure**
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = 'recipes' 
   ORDER BY column_name;
   ```

4. **Test Direct Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT name, category FROM recipes WHERE name ILIKE '%chicken%';
   ```
