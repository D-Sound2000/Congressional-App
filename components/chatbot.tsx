üåü **My Famous Herb-Crusted Baked Chicken**

‚è±Ô∏è **Takes about 45 minutes total** (but most of that is just waiting while it bakes!) | **Feeds 4 hungry people**

**Here's what you'll need:**
‚Ä¢ 4 chicken breasts (I like the 6 oz ones - not too big, not too small!)
‚Ä¢ 2 tbsp good olive oil (trust me, don't cheap out here!)
‚Ä¢ 1 tsp garlic powder (or fresh if you're feeling fancy)
‚Ä¢ 1 tsp sweet paprika (gives it that gorgeous color!)
‚Ä¢ 1 tsp dried oregano
‚Ä¢ 1/2 tsp thyme
‚Ä¢ 1/2 tsp onion powder
‚Ä¢ Salt and pepper to taste
‚Ä¢ 1/2 tsp rosemary
‚Ä¢ 1 whole lemon for juicing

**Let's make some magic happen:**
1. First things first - crank that oven to 375¬∞F! Line your baking dish with parchment (makes cleanup a breeze, you'll thank me later).

2. Pat those chicken breasts completely dry - this is KEY for getting that perfect crust! If they're super thick, give them a gentle pound to even them out.

3. Mix all your spices with the olive oil in a bowl. It'll smell absolutely incredible!

4. Now comes the fun part - massage that herb mixture all over the chicken. Don't be shy, really get in there!

5. Pop them in the dish, squeeze that lemon all over (so good!), and into the oven they go.

6. Bake for 25-30 minutes until they hit 165¬∞F inside. No pink, but don't overcook them!

7. Here's the secret - let them REST for 10 minutes before cutting. I know it's torture, but it keeps all the juices in!

**Why your blood sugar will thank you:** Only 2g carbs, but 35g of protein! The herbs are anti-inflammatory too. Serve with some roasted veggies and you've got yourself a perfect diabetes-friendly feast! üéâ`;
    }
    
    if (input.includes('salad')) {
      return `Ooh, you want a salad? I've got the PERFECT one for you! ü•óüòç This Mediterranean quinoa salad is like summer in a bowl - fresh, colorful, and so satisfying!

üåÖ **My Go-To Mediterranean Quinoa Salad**

üï∞Ô∏è **About 35 minutes from start to finish** (quinoa needs to cook and cool!) | **Plenty for 4 as a side, or 2 for lunch**

**Grab these goodies:**
‚Ä¢ 1 cup quinoa (rinse it first - gets rid of the bitter coating!)
‚Ä¢ 2 cups veggie broth (makes it way more flavorful than water)
‚Ä¢ 1 big cucumber, diced (I love the crunch!)
‚Ä¢ 1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes, cut in half
‚Ä¢ 1/4 cup red onion, minced fine (don't go crazy here!)
‚Ä¢ 1/2 cup Kalamata olives (the good stuff!)
‚Ä¢ 1/2 cup crumbled feta (because... feta makes everything better)
‚Ä¢ Fresh parsley and mint (seriously, don't skip these!)
‚Ä¢ 3 tbsp good olive oil
‚Ä¢ 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
‚Ä¢ 1 garlic clove, minced
‚Ä¢ Oregano, salt, and pepper

**Let's build this beauty:**
1. Cook your quinoa in the veggie broth - it's like giving it a flavor bath! 15 minutes covered, then let it rest and fluff it up.

2. While it's cooling (patience, my friend!), dice up all your veggies. Make them roughly the same size - it's prettier that way!

3. Whisk up that dressing - the lemon and olive oil combo is *chef's kiss*

4. Once everything's cool, toss it all together! Don't be gentle - really mix it up!

5. Here's the secret: let it chill for at least 30 minutes. The flavors get SO much better when they hang out together!

**Your diabetes-friendly win:** The quinoa gives you complete protein (rare for a grain!), tons of fiber to keep blood sugar steady, and those healthy Mediterranean fats are absolute gold! Plus it's only 28g carbs but packed with nutrients. This is what I call a power bowl! üí™‚ú®`;

üåÖ **The Ultimate Feel-Good Veggie Scramble**

‚è∞ **Ready in under 20 minutes!** | **Perfect for 2 (or just you if you're extra hungry!)**

**Here's your morning lineup:**
‚Ä¢ 4 beautiful eggs (the stars of the show!)
‚Ä¢ 2 tbsp unsweetened almond milk (makes them so fluffy!)
‚Ä¢ 1 tbsp olive oil
‚Ä¢ 1/4 onion, diced small
‚Ä¢ Half a red bell pepper (for that pop of color!)
‚Ä¢ Half a green bell pepper
‚Ä¢ A big handful of spinach
‚Ä¢ Some mushrooms, sliced
‚Ä¢ 1/4 cup shredded cheddar (because life's too short for bland eggs!)
‚Ä¢ Fresh chives for that fancy finish
‚Ä¢ Salt, pepper, and garlic powder

**Let's make breakfast magic:**
1. Whisk those eggs with the almond milk and seasonings until they're all happy together!

2. Heat up your pan - medium heat is your friend here. Too hot and you'll have rubbery eggs (yuck!).

3. Saut√© the onions first (they need more time), then add those gorgeous peppers and mushrooms. Listen to that sizzle!

4. Toss in the spinach and watch it magically shrink down in seconds!

5. Now for the good part - pour in those eggs and DON'T TOUCH for 30 seconds. Then gently scramble like you're folding laundry!

6. Right before they're done, fold in that cheese. Remove from heat - they'll finish cooking from the residual heat!

7. Sprinkle with chives and boom - you've got yourself a restaurant-worthy breakfast!

**Why this rocks for blood sugar:** You're getting 18g of protein (hello, steady energy!), tons of veggies for fiber and nutrients, and only 6g carbs. Your morning blood sugar will be as stable as your good mood after eating this! Pair with some avocado and you're absolutely golden! üåü`;
